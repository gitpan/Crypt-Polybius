NAME
    Crypt::Polybius - implementation of the Polybius square

SYNOPSIS
       use Crypt::Polybius;
   
       #      1    2    3    4    5
       # 1    A    B    C    D    E
       # 2    F    G    H    I/J  K
       # 3    L    M    N    O    P
       # 4    Q    R    S    T    U
       # 5    V    W    X    Y    Z
       #
       # ATTACK  ->  11 44 44 11 13 25
       # AT      ->  11 44
       # DAWN    ->  14 11 52 33
   
       my $square = Crypt::Polybius->new;
   
       print $square->encipher('Attack at dawn.'), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an implementation of the Polybius square, or Polybius
    checkerboard. This cipher is not cryptographically strong, nor completely
    round-trip-safe.

  Constructor
    `new(%attributes)`
        Moose-like constructor.

  Attributes
    `square`
        An array of arrays of letters. The default is:

           [
              [qw/ A B C D E /],
              [qw/ F G H I K /],
              [qw/ L M N O P /],
              [qw/ Q R S T U /],
              [qw/ V W X Y Z /],
           ]

    `substitutions`
        A hashref of strings of pre-encipher substitutions to make. The
        default is:

           { "J" => "I" }

        You should only use upper-case letters.

  Methods
    `encipher($str)`
        Enciphers a string and returns the ciphertext.

    `decipher($str)`
        Deciphers a string and returns the plaintext.

    `preprocess($str)`
        Perform pre-encipher processing on a string. `encipher` calls this, so
        you are unlikely to need to call it yourself.
